            <br />
            Given the absolute necessity of an online presence in modern business, it's no surprise that the term "SEO" remains <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=SEO" target="_blank">among the most popular Google searches year-round</a>. Everyone needs it, but relatively few people know how
            to approach the subject with any degree of confidence- especially given the fact that SEO requires a multi-faceted approach for true success.
            <br /> <br />
            While perfect SEO is a moving target due to ever-changing ranking algorithms, <em>keywords</em> are one of the most straightforward aspects of any approach. Their purpose is to answer two
            fundamental questions about your business, and particiularly about each page on your website:
            <br /> <br />
            <strong>1) What are you offering?</strong>
            <br />
            <strong>2) What words and phrases are people using in an attempt to find it?</strong>
            <br /> <br />
            Properly utilizing the answers to those questions helps drive more targeted traffic, which will increase your clickthrough rates and, by direct association, your sales.
            By way of extended example, let us assume that a business specializes in outdoor equipment, and the current sale they'd like to direct traffic to is for a high-end mountain bike. The keywords for that page would likely look something like the following:
            <br /> <br />
            <em>[brand name / model] mountain bikes, high end mountain bikes, mountain bikes on sale, mountain bikes, bikes, bicycles...</em>
            <br /> <br />
            The remainder of that keyword list is generated from market- and area-specific search trends, and that collection of keywords becomes a powerful tool for generating traffic when concentrated into keyword-focused content writing.
            <br /> <br />
            <span class="example-title mini-title">Keywords Now vs Keywords Then</span>
            <br />
            A glance into the code for websites from a decade or two ago would reveal one common, prevailing theme: a <code>&ltmeta></code> tag stuffed full of a list of keywords like the one we generated above. Doing so now is significantly more likely to <a href="https://support.seomanager.com/article/30-keywords-meta-field-is-no-longer-used-by-google" target="_blank">hurt your search rankings</a> than help them.
            Those keywords, however, are still just as vital as they were before- they've just found a new home. Rather than cramming an extensive list into a single, invisible tag at the top of your web page, those keywords are sprinkled into other, useful <code>&ltmeta></code> tags (such as description, meta description, and meta title tags), as well as throughout the content for each and every page.
            <br /> <br />
            The difficult portion of the process only now comes into play: finding a way to include those keywords in your content in a way that doesn't seem forced or unnecessary. Content that isn't interesting or engaging, or that is rife with grammatical errors and inconsistencies, will make a customer click away, and that quick exit tells Google and other search engines that you didn't have what they were looking for.
            <br /> <br />
            Content that genuinely draws in customers requires a careful balance: accurate keywords placed throughout your pages to correctly indicate each page's focus, but not so many that the writing feels mechanical and bland.
          </p>

            <span class="example-title">More Keyword Examples</span>
            <br />
            For a website focused on content writing, such as my own, I would use the following list as a guide in the creation of its pages:
          <br /> <br />
          <em>content writing, content writer, writing, writer, copywriter, copyeditor, proofreading, editing...</em>
          <br /> <br />
          A keyword list tailored to your needs, combined with fitting synonyms, carefully-considered word combinations, and thoughtful transitions, can catapult your website into the top results for relevant rankings.
